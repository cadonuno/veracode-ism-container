## About This Project


veracode-ism-container is a containerised implementation of Veracode's Internal Scanning Manager (ISM).

The Veracode ISM is an agent to help simplify the scanning of applications that cannot be reached from the public internet. It is a Java agent that connects back to the Veracode platform to create a secure tunnel for scan traffic.


This is not an official Veracode project.
